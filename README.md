# Covid19DataAnalysis
Python project to study distributed k mean clustering on different covid-19 datasets


Purpose of this study is to implement distributed and centralized versions of K-Means algorithm on the same dataset. It allow us to assure that the two different versions reach the same final results. 

K-Means clustering provides a comparison between behaviour of different regions against the pandemic.
